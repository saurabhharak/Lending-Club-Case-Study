## General Information
- Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal
  loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can
  easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
  When the company receives a loan application, the company has to
  make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Likely
  to pay and not likely to repay the loan are two types of risks associated
  based on the decision.
